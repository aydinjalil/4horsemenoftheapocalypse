Our project aims to visualize the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the aviation industry by plotting the rapidly declining volume of air traffic over the past few months. We will be creating a chart showing the air traffic at various airports over time, with a slider showing the progression over days. Likely this will be a bubble chart showing the bubbles for each airport shrinking/growing over time. We will also include the coronavirus infection rates to compare against these somewhere on the page.

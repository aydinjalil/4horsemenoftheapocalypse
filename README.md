Our project aims to visualize the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the aviation industry by plotting the rapidly declining volume of air traffic over the past few months. We will be creating a d3 line chart that can be interacted with to change the data it displays from total air traffic, to commercial air traffic, to showing the infection rates of the pandemic itself.

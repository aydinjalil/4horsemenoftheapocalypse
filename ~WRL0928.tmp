Our project aims to visualize the popularity of many programming language with various types of programmers utilizing the stack overflow developer survey for 2019. We will create a bar chart showing the number of programmers utilizing each language polled divided into various categories such as if a programmer is a hobbyist or not, years spent programming, country of origin, education level, and etc. with different visualizations for each. 

Our project aims to visualize the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the aviation industry by plotting the rapidly declining volume of air traffic over the past few months. We will be creating a chart showing the air traffic at various airports over time, with a slider showing the progression over days. Likely this will be a bubble chart showing the bubbles for each airport shrinking/growing over time. We will also include the coronavirus infection rates to compare against these somewhere on the page.
